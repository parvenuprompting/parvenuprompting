## Tiëndo Welles — Agentic Architect
I design systems where AI builds software, not the other way around.

Architecture > Code  
Determinism > Guessing  
Systems > Features

---

### What I’m Building
I’m building AI-first software systems focused on:
- Agentic code orchestration
- Deterministic AI workflows
- Browser-first and cloud-native platforms

**Flagship directions:**
- **Engineer Flow** — diagnostic & knowledge systems for heavy vehicles
- **Kairos OS** — governance & orchestration layer for AI code agents
- **AI Fusion workflows** — multi-agent validation across models

---

### How I Think
My work is guided by a few non-negotiables:

- Architecture before implementation
- Deterministic systems over probabilistic hacks
- Clear contracts (schemas, rules, governance)
- AI as an operator, not a magic box

I don’t chase frameworks.  
I design the rules they must obey.

---

### Current Focus
- Designing governance systems for AI code agents
- Turning certification knowledge into executable capability schemas
- Reducing feature-creep through strict v1 contracts

---

### Collaboration
I collaborate best with people who:
- Think in systems, not tickets
- Value clarity over speed
- Can challenge assumptions without ego
